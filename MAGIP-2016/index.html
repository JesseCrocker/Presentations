				The cartography generations of Americans are used to...

			    <aside class="notes">
I work on an app called Gaia GPS, used by lots of outdoor recreationists for offline navigation on smartphones. The maps of choice for most of our users in the US is the USGS 7.5 minute quads. People have grown up with USGS quads so they are already familiar with them, and they are easy to read in the outdoor because they have very high contrast.

    			<aside class="notes">
But these maps are getting very out of date. Many maps were last updated in 1980, and the series was offially declared complete in 1992.

					US Topo - No There There
					<img src="ustopo-madison.png">
				    <aside class="notes">
The USGS started from scratch making the new US Topo map series in 2009 as a replacement for the 7.5" quads. These maps are produced digitally, they have the classic USGS look, and are updated on a 3 year cycle, but there is so little information on on many maps that they are almost useless for outdoor recreation.

You might be familiar with OpenStreetMap as that ugly map used by people too cheap to pay for google maps. But it's much more than that. It's a worldwide crowd-sourced open licensed database of geographic knowledge.

OpenStreetMap has over half a million contributors, some have only made 1 contribution, some map 50 hours a week. In many areas the map was not started from scratch, but was seeded with imports of public domain data.

In the US TIGER roads and NHD hydrology were imported, and starting from that base the community has built a map. It's not perfect, especially in rural areas, but in highly trafficed areas it's really good, and in almost all areas it's better than US Topo.

					Not everything we need

But OpenStreetMap does not contain everything we need to make a topo map. It doesn't have contour lines.

					A few notes about technology
					<img src="webgl-earth2x.png">
					<aside class="notes">
Most maps on the internet are rendered as tiles. The map is rendered at multiple zoom levels, and each level has 4 times as many tiles as the previous level. At zoom 0 the whole planet is on 1 tile, at zoom 1 the planet is divided into 4 tiles, etc. At zoom 16 planet is divided into 4,294,967,296 tiles. The maps i'm talking about are tiled, but instead of raster image tiles, they are vector tiles.

					<aside class="notes">
Vector tiles contain geometries and attributes instead of images.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					Why?
					<aside class="notes">
Vector tiles add an additional level of abstraction between the data is what the user sees, and that abstraction does have a cost, in terms of developer effort, technological complexity, and file storage, but the cost is outweighed by the benefits.
					</aside>

				<section>
					Multiple Styles
					<img src="multiple-styles.png">
					<aside class="notes">
Querying features from a database is usually the slowest part of rendering a map, and with vector tiles you can make those queries once to generate the vector tiles, and then render multiple map styles from the same vector tiles.

					Pixel perfect at multiple scales

					<aside class="notes">
Modern computer have a wide range of screen pixel densities, with vector tiles you can easily render pixel perfect rasters for any screen scale.

					On Device vector rendering
					<br>
					<img src="on-device-vector.gif">
					<aside class="notes">
Map intefaces on desktop computers generally jump between fixed zoom levels, but on mobile devices users expect to be able to continuously zoom, so those nice crisp raster tiles are usually being resampled to display on screen, but with vector tiles the map can be rendered crisply at any zoom level. Vector tiles provide another big advantage on mobile devices, fewer files to download at high zoom levels: many vector tile sets will only go to zoom 14 which is equivalant to a scale of 1:34,000, but the tiles contain enough resolution in the geometries they can produce good looking maps up to zoom 19, or 1:1,000. In cases where users are downloading maps for offline use this is a huge win.

					Software?

					<img src="Mapbox-Graphic.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
All of the GIS and cartography I do is with open source software, some that i've written, but most written by other people. Much of the work on vector tiles has been done by Mapbox, and the specific tile format im talking about is called Mapbox Vector Tiles. ESRI has recently adopted the Mapbox Vector Tile format, but I know very little that ecosystem. Two of the main tools I use are Postgis for storing and querying data, and Mapnik, which is a map rendering library. There are lots of smaller tools that glue things together, and most of those are written in Javascript.

					Gaia Topo
					<br>
					<img src="gaiatopo-intro.gif">
					<aside class="notes">
This is Gaia Topo, a Topo map inspired by the USGS cartographic style, but produced with open data, with global coverage, rendered with vector tiles, available with elevations in feet or meters, and updated every 6 hours.

					Production Workflow
					<img src="osm-topo-processing.png">
					<br>
					<aside class="notes">
Last month Gaia Topo served 185 million raster tiles, proccessed 124 batches of updates from OpenStreetMap, and re-rendered 7 million vector tiles. We dont have enough time now to go over all the parts of the infrastructure needed to make that work, so im going to go over a slightly simplified version of the tile production workflow.

				<section>
					Contour lines
					<br>
					<img src="contour-processing.png">
					<aside class="notes">
The first step of the production process was generating 2 sets of vector tiles for contour lines, one in feet, and one in meters. The contour line processing takes a long time, so this step was only done once, rather than each time the OpenStreetMap data was updated. Having the contour lines as a separate set of tiles also enables using them for other things, like rendering them on top of satellite images.
The contour lines are generated by downloading several different sets of digital elevation models and layering them on top of each other to fill any voids, and get the highest resolution data available. Then the gdal_dem tool is used to generate shapefiles of contour lines from the DEMs, the shapefiles are then fed into a custom tool I wrote for processing the contour lines into vector tiles, and the vector tiles are saved to amazon s3.

				<section>
					<img src="osm-workflow.png">
					<aside class="notes">
The complete set of OSM data is known as the planet file, currently the planet is about 33 GB. That file is processed with a tool called osm2pgsql that takes OSM data, either a full planet file, or a regional extract, and a style file that defines filering rules and transformations, and populates a postgres database. Some of the OSM data, like coastlines and ice sheets, requires additional processing steps and is made available as proccessed shapefiles, these shapefiles are downloaded and loaded into the same postgres database using shp2pgsql. Once the data is all loaded in the database, the vector tiles are rendered using Mapnik. Mapnik takes a tm2source file which defines a series of layers and a sql query for each layer, and generates the vector tiles. The tiles are then saved to amazon s3. When a client requests a tile that request goes to another instance of mapnik, this one has a tm2 file that contains a stylesheet to render vector tiles into rasters, and additional raster assets for icons and polygon fills. Mapnik requests the OSM vector tile, and a contour line vector tile,  combines the 2 together, applies the stylesheet, and then returns the raster to the client.
